        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This concept refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to certain components of an object to protect the integrity of the data, allowing only authorized parts of the code to modify it. This is achieved through access modifiers like private, public, and protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It helps to simplify the use of objects and focus on what they do rather than how they do it. Abstract classes and interfaces in programming languages like Java and C++ are examples of abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) can inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time) and method overriding (runtime).\n",
        "\n",
        "Class and Object: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have. An object is an instance of a class that contains actual values for the attributes defined in the class. Objects interact with one another using methods."

        "Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes during inheritance. When you call a method on an object, Python needs to determine which class's method should be invoked, especially in cases of multiple inheritance. MRO defines the path Python follows to resolve method calls.\n",
