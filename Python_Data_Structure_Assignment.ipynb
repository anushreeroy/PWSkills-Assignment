        "Answer:\n",
        "String slicing in Python refers to extracting a portion (or substring) of a string using a specific range of indices. Python strings are sequences, so slicing allows you to access parts of them using a colon (:) within square brackets.\n",
        "Basic Syntax:\n",
        "string[start:stop:step]\n",
        "start: The starting index (inclusive). If omitted, it defaults to the beginning of the string.\n",
        "stop: The ending index (exclusive). If omitted, it defaults to the end of the string.\n",
        "step: The step value (optional). Defines how many characters to jump. If omitted, the default step is 1.Positive for forward traversal, but negative for reverse traversal\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "1. Slicing a Substring:\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[0:5])  \n",
        "# Output: 'Hello'\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Omitting start or stop:\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"Python Programming\"\n",
        "print(text[:6])    \n",
        "print(text[7:])    \n",
        "\n",
        "# Output: 'Python'  (start defaults to 0)\n",
        "# Output: 'Programming' (goes till the end)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Using Negative Indices:\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[-6:])   \n",
        "print(text[:-7])   \n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists in Python are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures. They are mutable, ordered collections of items (elements) that can hold a variety of data types. Here's a breakdown of the key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ordered Collection:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Lists maintain the order of elements, meaning the items appear in the same sequence in which they were inserted.\n",
        "*   Each element has an index, starting from 0 for the first element.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mutable (Changeable):\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after the list has been created. You can update, add, or remove items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Heterogeneous Elements:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists can store elements of different data types, including integers, strings, floats, and even other lists (nested lists).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Dynamic Size:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists in Python are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed. You can add or remove elements without needing to declare a fixed size at the time of creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Supports Slicing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Like strings, lists support slicing, allowing you to access sublists or portions of the list using the start:stop:step syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Iterability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are iterable, meaning you can loop through them using a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Nested Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists can contain other lists, allowing for multi-dimensional data structures like matrices or grids.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Indexing and Negative Indexing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists support zero-based indexing. You can also use negative indexing to access elements from the end of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Supports List Comprehensions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python allows the creation of new lists using a concise syntax called list comprehensions. This feature is particularly useful for generating lists dynamically.\n",
