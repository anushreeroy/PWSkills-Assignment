Its main purpose is to provide support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Here’s how it enhances Python’s capabilities for numerical operations:\n",

        "Vectorization and broadcasting are two powerful concepts in NumPy that enhance the efficiency of array operations, making computations faster and more intuitive.\n",

        "Vectorization\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Vectorization refers to the ability to perform operations on entire arrays or large datasets without the need for explicit loops in Python. Instead of iterating through elements one by one, NumPy allows operations to be applied directly to whole arrays at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Performance: Operations are executed in optimized, low-level C code, which is significantly faster than Python loops.\n",
        "* Simplicity: Code is more concise and readable, reducing complexity in array manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Instead of using a loop to add two arrays element-wise, you can directly use:\n",
        "\n",

        "Broadcasting\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Broadcasting is a technique that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. When the shapes of the arrays are compatible, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one during the operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rules for Broadcasting:\n",
        "\n",
        "* If the arrays have different numbers of dimensions, the shape of the smaller-dimensional array is padded with ones on the left until both shapes are the same.\n",
        "* The sizes of the dimensions are compared element-wise. They are compatible when:\n",
        "They are equal, or\n",
        "One of them is 1 (which allows for expansion).\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Allows operations between arrays of different shapes without needing to manually reshape them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency: Reduces memory overhead since no actual copying of data is required; broadcasting creates a view instead of duplicating the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Adding a scalar to a 1D array automatically broadcasts the scalar to each element of the array:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "c = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
